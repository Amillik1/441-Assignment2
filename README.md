# 441-Assignment2

This assignment makes use of a custom surface to create tiles for a board game. I wanted to complete this project with scroll and other tap functionalities, but could not do it in the scope of this assignment. This project will be returned to later to implement more functions of the game. Currently, it will draw the tiles, and if you tap on a tile it will highlight that tile.

The game is named Harbor Island Run, created by my dad and grandfather. There are 3 types of tiles; Sun, Tree, and Cloud. Each can knock one other type off of the board, kind of like rock paper scissors. The goal of the game is to get all of your tiles around the board and into your safe area. The game is easy to pick up and learn, and fun to play.
